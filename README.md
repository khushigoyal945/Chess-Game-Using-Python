# Chess-Game-Using-Python
The project is a text-based chess game developed in Python using Object-Oriented Programming. It allows two players to play chess by following standard rules, with features like move validation, alternating turns, and check detection. The code uses a modular structure with classes for each piece and a board manager. Despite challenges in implementing piece movements and input handling, the team successfully created a functional game. They strengthened their OOP and debugging skills, and plan to enhance the project with a GUI, AI opponent, and save/load options in the future.
